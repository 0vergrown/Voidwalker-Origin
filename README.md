**This Pack Adds:**
- Custom Origin

**Origin Detail:**

Icon: Crying Obsidian <br />
Impact: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ <br />
Description: Voidwalkers are a human subspecies infused with Void Energy. They have the capability to cultivate, manifest and control Void Energy after acting as a battery and a conduit for said energy.

*Positive* ðŸŸ¢:
- **Blink**: You can slip through space-time, at will, and appear a short distance away. (Primary)
- **Levitation**: Gravity bends to your will! You have the capability to levitate freely in space, creating your own leverage from nothing. (Secondary)
- **Gravity Manipulation**: The generation of a singularity that drastically changed the magnitude of gravity in local space.(Save Toolbar Activator)
- **Chaotic Accelerant**: You gain strength when overcharged with void energy. This Overcharge makes you a glass cannon and multiplies all damage dealt and received. (Load Toolbar Activator)
- **Entropic Bloom**: Using the Energy of the Void, you can focus on a single point in your view and cause an explosion. (Spectator Outlines)

*Neutral* ðŸŸ¡:
- **Void Energy**: You charge your body with the essence of the Void. This Void Energy is then used for all of your abilities.
- **Path of the Void**: The Path of the Void grants more durable skin, but with a cost of a diminished life force.
-- **Active Ability Passives**: Blink will cause temporary blindness whilst shifting through space-time. Using Gravity Manipulation, you will be pulled down by the singularity you created, temporarily inhibiting movement. Using Chaotic Accelerant will overcharge your body with Void energy. This overflow of Void energy constantly is being excreted from your body causing a purple glow around yourself. It will also act as a lens over your eyes.

*Negative* ðŸ”´:
- **Field Forces**: Due to the nature of The Voidwalker, you no longer feel a need to use a shield, instead of focusing more on dodges.
